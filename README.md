# Hospital Project Data Structure Project
This is the final project for the second introductory programming course (term 1B) taken at Camosun College.  Over the course of the term, various data structures and algorithms were developed as server classes.  The overarching theme was to incorporate them into some sort of contrived hospital management utility at the end of the term.  We had a great deal of flexibility to decide and plan what the final project looked like.  Here, I decided to build a Swing GUI on top of the modified server classes that I had been building throughout the term. I spent a great deal of time learning concepts that were beyond what was covered in the course, some of which I incorporated into this projected.  As such, this project provided a great learning opportunity.

Things that I learned and incorporated into this project:
- Managing complexity in a large project through Object Oriented Design principles (interfaces, generics, polymorphism, encapsulation, packages) and UML modeling
- The Static Factory Method approach used by Joshua Bloch in his book Effective Java 2nd Ed. (through self-study)
- The power of generics coupled with polymorphism to allow flexibility and reuse of algorithms and data structures (through self-study)
- Swing GUI design, and using NetBeans' GUI builder to build complex GUIs (through self-study)
- Serialization and reading/writing files to disk (primarily through self study)
- Proper Javadoc
- Linked data structures
- Exception Handling and custom exceptions 
- Automated unit testing with JUnit
- Learned the basics of git (through self-study)
- Learned the basics of designing with recursion (primarily through self study)

Looking back, there are a number of things I would change were I to re-write this project with my current level of ability.  Primarily, would re-write most of the algorithms/data-structures to incorporate priority queues (with heaps), dictionaries (with hash-maps), dynamic arrays, and faster sorting. Rather than a jumble of assorted server classes recycled from previous projects, I would plan and build the project from the ground up with a more-focused design. My git history could also be cleaner, since I was in the midst of learning git/github through self study while working on this project. Of course, this project was a past learning opportunity and it reflects that.

Thank you for your interest, please contact me with any questions.
